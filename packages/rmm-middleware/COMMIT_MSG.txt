refactor: Use StoredMessage[] throughout buffer

- Messages stay as StoredMessage[] (plain objects) throughout the system
- Remove serializeMessages/deserializeMessages conversion functions
- Buffer.messages is now StoredMessage[] matching LangChain's format
- Add toStoredMessage helper for BaseMessage conversion at append boundary
- No conversion needed at BaseStore storage boundary
